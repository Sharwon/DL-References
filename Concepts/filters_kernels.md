Kernel size selection is often supported in the filter kernel options in the image processing packages, such as all the imfilter related functions in Matlab image processing toolbox. Yet I would also like to take an high-pass filter example if you design the filters by yourself. For a square kernel with odd dimensions, the value for all filter weights can be set to a negative value, except for the center cell, which has a positive value which increases with the size of the kernel; A square kernel that has even dimensions has the positive value in the central group of four cells; A rectangular kernel has a center group of positive value cells in proportion to the kernel's dimensions
